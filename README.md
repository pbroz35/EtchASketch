This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Etch-a-Sketch game, where users can draw on a virtual canvas using their mouse. The project showcases my CSS, HTML, and JavaScript skills. The game provides a simple and interactive user interface, allowing users to create their artistic masterpieces.
